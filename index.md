## Track Day

With Track Day, you can accurately monitor your pace when running on a track. Type in your goal pace and distance for each interval, and Track Day will help you keep the pace as you run.

The watch will show you a countdown for each 100m and vibrate exactly when you should hit each 100m. Additionally, the app will allow you to plan several different intervals with distance and pace that can be run in succession.

With Track Day, you:
Don't have to calculate the time it will take you to run 100m or a single lap in a given pace.
Don't have to remember the different intervals you should switch between.

The app handles this for you, and will indicate to you when you are running too fast or too slow.
